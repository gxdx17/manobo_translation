"Nò, nighipanow on si Hisus mgo hibatoon din no nokouma on dio to Gitsimini. Kagi rin kandan to, “Pinnuu kow kai su dutun a pad og-ampu.”","Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”"
Woy nigduma rin si Pedro woy ka darua no anak ni Sibidiu. Nigmasakit lagboy so goinawa rin woy lagboy sikandin naaras.,"He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled."
"Kagi rin kandan to, “Sasakiti amana so goinawa ku to soin no igkasasow ku no inat to ogkamatoy ad. Palinggalat kow kai di kono kow oghirogo.”","Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”"

"No to niglibong si Hisus dio to sikan no tatolu no hibatoon din, nohirogo on sikandan. Nig-insaan din si Pedro to, “Manio no waro ka makabantoy to agad songo oras do?",Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.

"No kagi ni Hisus to mgo hibatoon din, “Manio naan to ogkahallok kow? Waro kow pad buwa mogsalig koddi?”","He said to his disciples, ""Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"""

Nigdatong si Hisus duma to mgo hibatoon din dio to dohipag to Lanow to Galilia dio to ugpaan to mgo Girisinis.,They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
"Poglogsad ni Hisus, nigtagbu sikandin to lukos no pigbusawan no dio nigpuun sikandin to mgo pilang no lobonganan.","When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him."
"Kono ogkabanggutan ka sikan no otow to agad hondoi no otow. Malasi bangguti ka mgo bolad din to karina woy ka paa rin to igpakagat no putow.

Agad hondoi no otow, waro ogpakabakus kandin.","This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain. For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him."
"Ko maallow woy ko marusilom, ungod din oglougloug dio to mgo sabalanan woy dio to mgo malopot no bubungan no ungod ogpangiak woy ungod din ogpalii to batu no magalang ka lawa rin.",Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
Ko nigkita rin si Hisus no dio pad to mariu nigpalpallaguy sikandin no ogdalapak kandin woy nigluhud dio to tangkaan ni Hisus.,"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him."

"Soini ka pogbuyu din su nigkagian on ni Hisus ka busow no kagi rin, “Koykow no busow no nigsolod to soin no otow, libuwas kad to soin no otow.”","For Jesus had said to him, ""Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"""

"No, ungod nighangyu no kagi rin, “Ko nu dogila ka mgo busow dio to dangob no ugpaan.”","""My name is Legion,"" he replied, ""for we are many."" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area."
"No, ogpamukal ka mohon-ing no mgo babuy dio to masandig no kono no amana no mariu.",A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
"No nigpohoy-uhoy-u ka mgo busow dio ki Hisus to, “Pohondia koy nasi to sikan no mgo babuy. Dio koy pasolora to mgo babuy.”","The demons begged Jesus, ""Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."""

Duon buwa ka darua no libu no babuy no natibo, nigmamallaguy no nakatinugpu dio to lanow no nalonod on ka tibo.","He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned."
"No, nigmamallaguy on ka mgo talagbantoy to sika mgo babuy no oghondio to lunsud, mgo hilit no ognangonan dan ka mgo otow to nakitaan dan tongod to otow woy ka mgo babuy.

"Pogkouma ran dio ki Hisus, nigkita ran ka sika lukos no warad ka mgo busow to lawa rin. Ogpinpinnuu ro no nanginabo on no maroyow on ka doromdomon din to warad ka mgo busow.

Ka mgo otow no nakakita nignangonan dan on ka duma no mgo otow to nokoy ka nohimuan to sikan no otow no pigbusawan woy tongod to mgo babuy.,Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demonpossessed man--and told about the pigs as well.
"Nò, nigbunsuran to mgo otow to oghangyu ki Hisus to og-ongkoran din ka kandan no tano.",Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
"Pogsakoy ni Hisus to balutu dan, nighangyu ka lukos no warad on mgo busow to lawa rin ki Hisus to ogduma porom kandin.","As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him."
"Di waro dumaa ni Hisus. Kagi ni Hisus kandin, “Uli kad on dio to koykow no ugpaan.

"Nò, nighipanow dio to kandin no ugpaan no nighingaranan to Dikapolis su duon sampulu no lunsud dio. Niglogoblogob din ka sikan sampulu no lunsud no ognangonnangon to mgo otow bahin to kabogbogan ni Hisus kandin no noinuinu ka tibo no mgo otow.",So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
"Ko nig-uli on woy si Hisus dio to dohipag to sika lanow, nakatagbu sikandan to mohon-ing no mgo otow no nalibulung dio.","When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake."
"No nokouma ka songo igbuyag to anaranan to mgo og-ampu no si Hairu ka ngaran din. Pogkita rin ki Hisus, nigluhud dio to tangkaan din.","Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet"

"Nò, nigduma on si Hisus kandin. Nanduma ka mohon-ing no mgo otow ki Hisus no nalingotan to mgo otow sikandin.",So Jesus went with him.
Duon ka songo boi no nigduma no sampulu ka tuid din woy darua ka garamon din to langosa rin no kono ogtigpok.,A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
"Agad nigpatambal to mohon-ing no mgo doktul, wa moulii. Niggamit din ka tibo no salapi din no ogbayad to mgo doktul di waro nigmaroyow.

"Nò, nigsamsam din ka sikaran to kinabo ni Hisus no sikan do ian no nigtigpok on ka langosa rin. Natagaan din on to noulian on ka dalu rin dio to diralom din.",Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
"No si Hisus, nataga on to niglibuwas to lawa rin ka doisok no kabogbogan din to ogbawi.

Manio naan to ogsasawon nu pad ka Maistru?”","While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. ""Your daughter is dead,"" they said. ""Why bother the teacher any more?"""
"Nakarinog si Hisus di nigbalagad din do duon ka kagi ran. Kagi ni Hisus atag ki Hairu, “Ko kad on ogkasasow to anak nu. Salig ka ro koddi.”","Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, ""Don't be afraid; just believe."""
"Nigparagas nighipanow si Hisus di wa din dumaa ka mgo otow. Si Pedro si Santiago, woy si Huan no hari ni Santiago do ka nigduma rin.","He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James."

Kagi rin to kandan no kinagian, “Talita kumi.” Ka lituk, “Igi, ka kagi ku koykow, onow kad on.”","After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, ""Talitha koum!"" (which means, ""Little girl, I say to you, get up!"" )."
"Nò, nig-onow ka bato no nigparagas nigsasindog woy nighihipanow dio to soog. Sampulu on woy darua ka tuid din. Noinuinu lagboy sikandan to pighimu ni Hisus.",Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.

Nigligkat si Hisus to sikan no ugpaan no nig-uli dio to kandin no lunsud no nigduma ka mgo hibatoon din.,"Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples."

"Kagi ni Hisus kandan to, “Agad hondoi, ogtahuron ka mgo talagnangon to kagi to Magboboot di kono ogtahuron to mgo otow dio to kandin no lunsud.

"No, ungod ognangon si Huan ki Hirodis to, “Kono ogkaayun to Balaod ta to og-asawoon ta ka ipag ta ko wa pad mamatoy ka asawa rin.”","For John had been saying to Herod, ""It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."""
Sikan ian ka igkabolu ni Hirodias ki Huan no ogpohimatayan din porom. Di kono ogbogoy si Hirodis to ogpohimatayan.,"So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,"

Nigdinog ka mgo Parisiu to molmohon-ing pad kun ka mgo ogkasakup ni Hisus no ogpabautismuan din to mgo ogkasakup ni Huan.,Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John—

"Mohon-ing so mgo otow no nanhondio ki Hisus. Kagi ran, “Waro nighimu si Huan to mgo igkoinuinu di malogot man ka tibo no innangon din bahin to soin no lukos.”","and many people came to him. They said, ""Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true."""
"Nò, nigtuu on kandin ka mohon-ing no mgo otow dio.",And in that place many believed in Jesus.
Duon ka sagboka no lukos no og-ugpo dio to lunsud to Bitania no si Lasaru ka ngaran din no nigdaralu sikandin. Matatalahari si Lasaru ki Maria woy si Marta no mgo ataboy rin no tibo nig-ugpo dio to Bitania.,"Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
"Soini no Maria, ian ka boi no nigbus-ug to mohomut no agua dio to paa ni Hisus woy nigtarapuan din to bulbul din. Ka kandin no maama no si Lasaru ka nigdaralu.","(This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.)"
"No, intugun to soin no patalahari no boi dio ki Hisus. no kagi ran, “Buyag, nigdaralu on ka lagboy no amigu nu no si Lasaru.”","So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”"

No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through it.”"
Dakol man so goinawa ni Hisus to sikan no mgo patatalahari no si Maria woy ka kakoy rin woy si Lasaru.,Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
"Di ko nigdinog on to nigdaralu si Lasaru, nigpalinggalat pad kandin to darua no allow dio to kandan no pigdatongan.","So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days,"

"Ka sikan no Balaod woy ka tibo no innangon to sikan no Balaod, nigligkat to Magboboot. Matul-id, matuwarong, woy waro solug no maroot su maroyow lagboy.","So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good."

Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful."
"Nataga kinow to maroyow man ka sikan no ingkasulat to Balaod su nigligkat man to Magboboot.

"Oghimuon ku poron ka maroyow, di ian ku nasi oghimuon ka maroot no kono ku igkoiniati.","For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing."

"Ka tu-tuu ian no goinawa ku, ogkarago a no ogtuman to mgo koiniatan to Magboboot.",For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;
"Di kai to lawa ku, duon loin no ogkoiniatan no ogpakaboot kanak. No ka sikan no mgo maroot no koiniatan, ogpakaatu to maroyow no doromdom no og-uyun poron to tu-tuu no goinawa ku.

So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin."
"Nò, kuntoon, sikanta no nasagboka on ki Hisu Kristu, kono kid on ogkabootan to logpad no ogligkat to Magboboot.","Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,"

"Ka otow, agad hontow, no ogpaboot to Gimukud to Magboboot, sikandan ka mgo anak to Magboboot.",For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.

Ian su ka Gimukud to Magboboot ka ogpasabut to kanta no goinawa to nohimu kinow on no mgo anak to Magboboot.,The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.

One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.
"Si Agar, songo igkapanag-iling to sikan no bubungan to Sinai no ian ligkatan to sikan no Balaod no ingkabogoy ki Moisis.

"Di sikanami, ogsalig koy atag to Magboboot to oghimuon kinow rin no maroyow dio to tangkaan din su ligkat to kabogbogan to Gimukud din woy ligkat dod to pogtuu ta ki Hisu Kristu.",For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope.

"Sikaniu, mgo sulod, maroyow man poron ka binunsuran to pog-unug now ki Hisus. No hontow man ka nigpasuwoy kaniu to nighagtong kow on to sikan no pog-unug now to tu-tuu ian no ingkaanad kaniu?",You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth?
Kono no ka Magboboot ka nigpasuwoy kaniu su sikandin ka nigpatuu kaniu to oyow ogpokohipanow kow to dalan no oghondio to kandin.,That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
